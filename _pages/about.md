Hi, I am ***Moosa***. I am a 1st year Computer Science PhD student at Penn State University, supervised [Dr. Wenpeng Yin](https://www.wenpengyin.org/).

My current research focus is on understanding **In-context Learning** in language models, including how to use **Task Instructions** to achieve better results. I am also interested in trainign dynamics of language models and how that knowledge can be used to achieve better continual learning in these models.

Previously, I was working on multilingual language models. Specifically I studied how to improve tokenization using transliteration to train better multilingual language models. Before that I worked at Samsung R&D Institute Bangladesh where I worked on Samsung Internet and MyFiles.

Some of the stuff that I enjoy other than my work:
1. Learning about history
2. [Reading books](https://www.goodreads.com/ibraheemmoosa)
3. [Watching movies](https://letterboxd.com/ibraheem_moosa/)
4. Trying out different cuisines and 
5. Running/hiking.

The best way to reach out to me is via email.
